          <h2>What is it?</h2>
          <p>
            Hanzi Driller is an application designed to train a Pavlovian
            response such that when you see a Chinese character, you instantly
            know how it's pronounced. To achieve this, you will be shown
            characters, and be prompted to type in the character's pronunciation
            and/or meaning. You can choose whether you want to drill only
            meanings, only pronunciations, or both. The goal is for you to go as
            quickly as possibly, and do multiple repetitions with each character
            until your response comes naturally, without thinking. Once you've
            selected your list, the application does all the work for you. All
            you have to do is type your responses, and the details are handled
            in the background.
          </p>
          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            You start by creating a list of characters to study with. Characters
            are numbered 1 to 6000, representing the 6,000 most common Chinese
            characters, in order of frequency. For example, if you want to drill
            the 500 most common characters, define your list as 1 to 500. The
            characters will be presented to you with the easiest (i.e., most
            common) characters first, and increase in difficulty as you master
            more characters. More advanced students should define their list
            with a higher starting point (e.g., 2000 to 3000). Your study list
            can be as large or as small as you want.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a built-in algorithm which will make sure that you will
            continue to learn new characters at a good rate, without letting you
            forget characters you have already learned or wasting time on
            characters you already know. All settings can be adjusted and
            fine-tuned for those who would like to customize their study
            experience.
          </p>
          <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
          <p>
            While Hanzi Driller is appropriate for any student of Mandarin
            Chinese, it is most suitable for intermediate and advanced learners.
            As an intermediate or advanced student of Chinese, you have often
            gained plenty of experience reading and mastered many Chinese
            characters, but you may find you often forget the pronunciation of
            certain characters which are less common. This application is
            designed to quickly identify the characters you struggle with and
            drill them until they are hard-wired in your memory. It is also a
            great tool for advanced students of Chinese who have a firm grasp of
            all the general use hanzi, but would like to expand their knowledge
            to less commonly used characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hanzi Driller is intended to be a supplement for your Chinese study
            regimen -- not a replacement for it. While this application will
            help you cement difficult and elusive Chinese character
            pronunciations in your memory, it is no replacement for a
            well-balanced study program based on reading and listening to
            comprehensible input.
